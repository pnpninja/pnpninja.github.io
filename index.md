### DevAuth - Device Based Federated Login

![P11](imgs/Combine.png)

Federated login using protocols like OpenID Connect is convenient as it solves the problem of password reuse by allowing the use of the same account across different websites, but that creates another issue. The main problem in this infrastructure is reliance on these third-party identity providers to relay information to client applications. We seek to address the problem of our reliance on corporate ownership of sensitive user information. In this project,we developed a Proof of Concept to demonstrate a device based federated login mechanism that selectively allows client applications access to user information without them going through third parties. We design a flow for DevAuth that resembles the RFC-6819 implicit flow, and assess the security implications of such a protocol. We show that although future work needs to be done to holistically assess the protocol, it is a viable alternative to current federated login techniques.

### Semantic Approach for Classifying Twitter Users

![SocialMedia](imgs/SocialMedia.png)

Social Media has grown rapidly in the past several years. Twitter in particular has seen a significant rise in its user audience because of the short and compact Tweet concept (140 characters). As more users come on board, it provides a large market for companies to advertise and and prospective customers by classifying users into different market categories. Traditional classification methods use TF-IDF and bag of words concept as the feature vector which inevitably is of large dimensions. In this project, we propose a method to improve the method of classification by using semantic information to reduce dimensions of the feature vectors and validate this method by feeding them into multiple learning algorithms and evaluating the results.

### Political Bias Estimation

![Graph](imgs/dp.png)

Most of the News and Media organizations in the world have some direct or indirect political affiliations, hence the content generated by these organizations is biased towards the respective ideologies of the political parties that the news organization is affiliated with.We aim to find the political leanings of few of the leading newspapers in India. This holds relevance as India is the worldâ€™s largest democracy with more than 1700 political parties and also the largest market for newspapers in the world with over 100 million copies sold every day. A framework has been proposed integrating a Social graph approach and Natural Language Processing (Machine Learning) approach to identify and estimate bias in the Indian context. Further a case study has been performed analyzing Twitter Data of Indian News Organizations.

### Twitter Trending Topic Classification

In the era of Social Networking, tweeting is the newest trend. About 200 million tweets are being generated every day. Twitter provides a list of the most trending topics; it is often hard to understand what these topics are about. This project is to classify a set of tweets T1,T2,T3,...,Tn into general categories like Sports, Business, Entertainment, Technology, Food and Lifestyle and others. Each tweet can belong to more than one category.
