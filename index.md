### Where-to-next - A Google Local Recommendation System

![poster](imgs/poster.jpg)

In recent years, the use of systems that can make personalized recommendations using user data and purchase/visit history has increased significantly. Everyday millions of searches are made on Google, with a bulk of the searches attributed to look for reviews before visiting a particular place. User preference, Item popularity and User stringency while giving ratings vary over time, which adds to the complication of suggesting places. Traditional recommendation systems use collaborative and content-based methods, but do not incorporate time information. Hence, I have used variants of collaborative filtering methods to capture the temporal effects while making recommendations. This enables the system to make personalized recommendations.

The following different types of the recommendation models were implemented:

1. Neighbourhood Model (User-User collaborative filtering)
2. Latent-Factor Model
3. Content-Based Model

### Seattle Crime Visualization

![MandelBrot](imgs/Seattle-Crime.png)

Created an informational visualization to help the general public identify the high crime zones filtered by area, time, month and day of the week. Additionally, a secondary page in this visualization allows the user to compare two neighbourhoods of Seattle and show a much more granular vision of the crime incidence.

### Political Bias Estimation

![Graph](imgs/dp.png)

Most of the News and Media organizations in the world have some direct or indirect political affiliations, hence the content generated by these organizations is biased towards the respective ideologies of the political parties that the news organization is affiliated with.We aim to find the political leanings of few of the leading newspapers in India. This holds relevance as India is the worldâ€™s largest democracy with more than 1700 political parties and also the largest market for newspapers in the world with over 100 million copies sold every day. A framework has been proposed integrating a Social graph approach and Natural Language Processing (Machine Learning) approach to identify and estimate bias in the Indian context. Further a case study has been performed analyzing Twitter Data of Indian News Organizations.

### Twitter Trending Topic Classification

In the era of Social Networking, tweeting is the newest trend. About 200 million tweets are being generated every day. Twitter provides a list of the most trending topics; it is often hard to understand what these topics are about. This project is to classify a set of tweets T1,T2,T3,...,Tn into general categories like Sports, Business, Entertainment, Technology, Food and Lifestyle and others. Each tweet can belong to more than one category.
